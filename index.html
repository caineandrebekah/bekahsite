                <h1>This is Me!</h1>
                <p>Hi I'm Rebekah Nielsen, 
                    
            Welcome to my page! 

            If you've come across my page then you must be eager to learn more about me. Lucky for you, you're in the right place!
            Where to begin.... let's start with the basics. I'm married to my wonderful husband Caine Nielsen and together we share a son, Tyson Nielsen. 
            My son defintely keeps me busy most days! He's 3 and all about making life interesting. I try to live by a very positive and optimistic mindset.
            Family and self-care are both very important to me. I love singing, dancing, laughing, hiking, playing games, cooking, baking, and just in general learning and creating new things when I can.
            It's amazing the things you can teach yourself just by seeking out the knowledge. 

            I recently have also been a strong advocate for daily meditation. I'm very passionate about spiritual enegery and connecting with yourself. The world is very vast and sometimes we get a little carried away.
            This has helped me stay grounded and remember the little gifts in life as well. Learning to build relationships with your emotions and how to navigate them instead of letting them overtake you.

            As an added bonus I'm also an animal lover! I love all kinds of animals but I only care for 2 cats, and a dog currently. Bruno, Gine & Lola. They're also an added handful, but they know how to butter me up for sure!
            Overall I am here to live my life to the fullest and make memories. Life is a gift and sometimes it can throw unexpected curveballs at us, so make it worth living. 

            Thanks for taking time to read a little bit about me, you can check out even more of my pages and let me know what you think!
